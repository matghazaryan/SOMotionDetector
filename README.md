SOMotionDetector
================

Simple library to detect motion for iOS by <b> matghazaryan</b>.

Based on location updates and acceleration.

###Requierments
iOS > 6.0 

Compatible with <b>iOS 9</b>

<b>Works on all iOS devices (i.e. not need M7 chip)</b>

This demo project also demonstrates how to use this library to relaunch the app from killed state.

USAGE
=====
Copy <b>SOMotionDetector</b> folder to your project.

Link <b>CoreMotion.framework</b>, <b>CoreLocation.framework</b>.

Import <b>"SOMotionDetector.h"</b> file and set SOMotionDetector's callbacks

```ObjC
#import "SOMotionDetector.h

//...

[SOMotionDetector sharedInstance].motionTypeChangedBlock = ^(SOMotionType motionType) {
    //...
};
    
[SOMotionDetector sharedInstance].locationChangedBlock = ^(CLLocation *location) {
    //...
};

[SOMotionDetector sharedInstance].accelerationChangedBlock = ^(CMAcceleration acceleration) {
    //...    
};
```

If you need to know when location updates were automatically paused due to your app running in the background...

```ObjC
[SOMotionDetector sharedInstance].locationWasPausedBlock = ^(BOOL changed) {
    //...    
};
```

###NOTE!
To Support iOS > 8.0 you must add in your info.plist file one of the following keys: <br>
`NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription`<br> `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription`

To enable background location updates in iOS > 9.0 you must set `allowsBackgroundLocationUpdates` to `YES` <br>
```ObjC
    [SOLocationManager sharedInstance].allowsBackgroundLocationUpdates = YES;
```

You are done! 

Now to start motion detection just call
```ObjC 
[[SOMotionDetector sharedInstance] startDetection];
```

To stop detection call
```ObjC 
[[SOMotionDetector sharedInstance] stopDetection];
```  

To start step counter call
```ObjC
    [[SOStepDetector sharedInstance] startDetectionWithUpdateBlock:^(NSError *error) {
        //...
    }];
```
###Detecting motion types
```ObjC
typedef enum
{
  MotionTypeNotMoving = 1,
  MotionTypeWalking,
  MotionTypeRunning,
  MotionTypeAutomotive
} SOMotionType;
```

CUSTOMIZATION
=============
```ObjC

/**
 * Set this parameter to YES if you want to use M7 chip to detect more exact motion type. By default is No.
 * Set this parameter before calling startDetection method.
 * Available only on devices that have M7 chip. At this time only the iPhone 5S, the iPad Air and iPad mini with retina display have the M7 coprocessor.
 */
@property (nonatomic) BOOL useM7IfAvailable;

/**
 *@param speed  The minimum speed value less than which will be considered as not moving state
 */
- (void)setMinimumSpeed:(CGFloat)speed;

/**
 *@param speed  The maximum speed value more than which will be considered as running state
 */
- (void)setMaximumWalkingSpeed:(CGFloat)speed;

/**
 *@param speed  The maximum speed value more than which will be considered as automotive state
 */
- (void)setMaximumRunningSpeed:(CGFloat)speed;

/**
 *@param acceleration  The minimum acceleration value less than which will be considered as non shaking state
 */
- (void)setMinimumRunningAcceleration:(CGFloat)acceleration;

```

### Installation with CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Objective-C, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries installation in your projects.
